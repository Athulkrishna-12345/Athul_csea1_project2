           <b> <h2>Ingrediants required For making the Sambar:</b></h2>
1 cup toor dal (split pigeon peas)

2 tomatoes, chopped
1 green chili, slit

1 tbsp tamarind pulp
1 tsp jaggery (optional)

<h2>How to Make the Sambar:</h2>
Wash the toor dal and pressure cook it with 2 cups of water for 3-4 whistles. Let the pressure release naturally.
Heat the oil in a pressure cooker or a deep pot. Add the chopped onion, green chili, and ginger. Saut√© until the onion turns golden brown.
Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and release their juices.
Add the tamarind pulp and jaggery (if using) and cook for a few more minutes.
Add the cooked toor dal, sambar powder, and salt to taste. Mix well.
If using vegetables, add them now and cook until they are tender.
Add more water if needed to adjust the consistency of the sambar.
Bring the sambar to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, or until the flavors are well blended.

    You can also add a teaspoon of coconut milk to the sambar for a richer flavor.
